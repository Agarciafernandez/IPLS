This repository contains the Matlab implementation of the iterated posterior linearisation smoother (IPLS) [1], 
which is based on the posterior linearisation technique for Gaussian inference [2].
The extension of the IPLS for dynamic/measurement models based on conditional moments can be found in [3].




To run the IPLS algorithm, run the file
